## üêô Reflect for Go

**Reflect is an easy-to-use encrypted p2p pub/sub system with peer auto-discovery.**\
It also offers a p2p key-value pair database on top of that.

### Use case

You have a group of Go apps or a group of instances of a Go app and you want them to be able to comunicate with each other. You don't want to spend money on a Redis instance and you're afraid if you used a centralised system, it would have to be monitored and it could go down.

Reflect solves this by creating a mesh of encrypted TCP connections between your instances/apps. Every time an app wants to broadcast a message, reflect sends that message to all the other apps running in the same network. Each instance keeps an open connection to each other, so communication is very fast and does not rely on third-parties.

### How do I use it?

#### PubSub

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"

	"github.com/ivosequeros/reflect/mesh"
)

type message map[string]interface{}

func main() {
	/* Create mesh: */
	m := mesh.New(mesh.Options{
		/* A secret key is exchanged when the connection is established to verify that the other peer can join the mesh */
		Key: "SECRET_KEY",
	})

	/* Subscribe to a test event: */
	m.Subscribe("test", func(message map[string]interface{}) {
		fmt.Println("Content:", message["value"])
	})

	time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)

	/* Broadcast test event: */
	m.Broadcast("test", message{
		"value": "hello",
	})

	/* Keep app running: */
	select {}
}
```

It's as easy as to call `mesh.New`. This function returns a mesh object with 2 properties:

- `Subscribe` binds a handler to an event
- `Broadcast` sends a message to all the instances in the same local networ

#### Database

Basic example:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"github.com/ivosequeros/reflect/store"
)

func main() {
	/* Create store: */
	s := store.New(store.Options{
		/* A secret key is exchanged when the connection is established to verify that the other peer can join the mesh */
		Key: "SECRET_KEY",
    })
    
    s.Set("name", "Ivo")

    name := s.Get("name")
    fmt.Println(name)
}
```

Here's an extra example that you can run multiple times to see how the state is propagated:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math/rand"
	"strconv"
	"time"
	"github.com/ivosequeros/reflect/store"
)

func main() {
	/* Create store: */
	s := store.New(store.Options{
		/* A secret key is exchanged when the connection is established to verify that the other peer can join the mesh */
		Key: "SECRET_KEY",
	})

    /* Create a random number generator: */
	r := rand.New(rand.NewSource(time.Now().UnixNano()))

	n := strconv.Itoa(r.Intn(100))
	s.Set("Number", n)
	fmt.Println("Generated", n)

	for {
		fmt.Println("Read", s.Get("Number"))
		time.Sleep(time.Second * 2)
	}

	/* Keep app running: */
	select {}
}
```

It's as easy as to call `store.New`. This function returns a mesh object with 2 properties:

- `Get` gets the value of a key
- `Set` sets the value of a key

All changes made to any key value are propagated immediately across all instances in the same network. If any new instance joins the network, it is given the latest state of the database.
